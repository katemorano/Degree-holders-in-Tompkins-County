<h1> Over half the population of this rural county in New York have bachelor's degrees </h1>
<h3> Tompkins County in the Southern Tier region of the state defies the status quo, with nearly 60% of it's residents holding a bachelor's degree or higher despite the majority of the county being farmland </h3>

	<p> Generally, educated Americans congregate in large metropolitan areas and New York is mostly consistent with this trend, but Tompkins County is an anomaly. Less than 50 miles from the New York/Pennsylvania border, it is one of the smallest counties in the state at 476 square feet. Around a third of this area is farmland. And yet, it is the second most educated county in New York, outpaced only by Manhattan.</p>

	<p> One of the most prestigious universities in the country is the cause of this phenomenon. Cornell University, a member of the Ivy League, is located in the city of Ithaca, Tompkins County’s seat. Ithaca, while not an exceptionally large city, is a city on the rise; it continues to add jobs and grow it’s population while other cities in Upstate New York lag behind. About 1 in 5 workers in the county are employed by Cornell University, according to the college’s website, and around 30% of the county’s population are full-time college students.</p>
